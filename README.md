# kelp_persistence
This is the GitHub repository for a project led by Monterey Bay Aquarium aimed at understanding the community-wide consequences of kelp forest loss and 
the predictors of persistence through multiple stressors. The analyses and code in this respository support the findings presented in Smith et al. 2024

## Respository structure
