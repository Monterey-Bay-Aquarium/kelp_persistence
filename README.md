# kelp_persistence
This is the GitHub repository for a project led by the Monterey Bay Aquarium aimed at understanding the community-wide consequences of kelp forest loss and 
the predictors of persistence through multiple stressors. The analyses and code in this respository support the findings presented in Smith et al. 2023. 

## Respository structure 

The GitHub repository contains all of the code associated with the project and the figures produced by this code. 

The data for the project are kept in a server outside the GitHub repository. Non-confidential data will be made available in a public data repository upon project completion.

The GitHub repository has the following structure

* **output:** This folder contains subfolders for each dataset used in the project. The subfolders contain scripts that clean and visualize the data. Figures for visualizing each dataset are contained within a *figures* folder inside each subfolder.
* **analyses:** This folder contains subfolders that contain the analyses conducted in the paper.
* **figures:** This folder contains all of the high-res figures presented in the paper.
* **tables:** This folder contains all of the tables presented in the paper.

## Repository best practices

Project contributors are internal at this point in time. We ask that contributors adhere to the following best practices when working in the repository:

1. Use lower case for all folders and file names
2. Use underscores for spaces (don't use hyphens or spaces)
